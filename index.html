When I was little, I was an extremely clingy child, and it must have taken a lot of patience and love to always be there for me. These days, she still works in Nepal but constantly travels back and forth between Kathmandu and London to see me as much as possible, and I know the amount of travel she does must be exhausting, yet she\'s always excited as ever to get to see me and spend time with me. She\'s an amazing mother and an amazing person." — Biraj Khadka, Reporter',
